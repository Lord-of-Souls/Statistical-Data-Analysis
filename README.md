# Statistical Analysis of Customer Behavior

## Description
This project focuses on applying rigorous statistical methods to validate hypotheses regarding customer behavior. It moves beyond simple observation by using mathematical testing to determine if patterns in the data are statistically significant or merely the result of random chance.

## Project's Objective
The objective is to perform a deep dive into customer data through preliminary analysis and execute specific statistical tests to support data-driven decision-making.

## Results
- **Validated Hypotheses:** Documented proof of significant differences between customer segments.
- **Statistical Metrics:** Calculated T-test values and P-values to verify the reliability of the findings.
- **Visual Evidence:** A series of distribution charts and comparison graphs that illustrate the statistical outcomes.

## Methodology
1. **Preliminary Data Analysis:** Initial screening of data to check for normality and variance.
2. **Behavioral Study:** Grouping customers based on specific behaviors or demographics.
3. **Statistical Testing:** Applying Inferential Statistics to compare means and identify significant correlations.
4. **Interpretation:** Translating statistical results (rejecting or failing to reject the Null Hypothesis) into business insights.

## Utilized Tools
- **Language:** [Python](https://www.python.org)
- **Statistical Engine:** [SciPy](https://scipy.org) (specifically the `stats` module for T-tests).
- **Data Manipulation:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
- **Visualization:** [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org).
- **Environment:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org).

## Acquired/Developed Abilities
- **Inferential Statistics:** Practical application of T-tests and understanding of P-values.
- **Hypothesis Formulation:** Defining Null ($H_0$) and Alternative ($H_a$) hypotheses.
- **Data Distribution Analysis:** Using charts to check for normal distribution and outliers.
- **Scientific Programming:** Utilizing the SciPy ecosystem for technical computing.

## Upgrades to be Made
- [ ] Implement ANOVA tests for comparing more than two customer groups.
- [ ] Include Correlation Matrices to identify hidden relationships between variables.
- [ ] Add power analysis to determine the required sample size for future tests.

## How to Run It
You can run the project files in two ways:

### Option 1: Google Colab
1. Upload the `.ipynb` files directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Run the cells sequentially.

### Option 2: Local Environment (VS Code)
1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.orgdownloads/) installed.
2. Install the **Jupyter Extension** in VS Code.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and select your Python interpreter.
